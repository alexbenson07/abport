Thereâ€™s nothing better than seeing your work have a positive impact for your client and their customers. I strive to make something better everytime. Thats what keeps me motivated.',

But the more I researched and learned, the more I realized just how integral this concept is in this age of the internet. With users accessing so many site from so many different devices, premepting the user expectation and anticipating their needs has become ever more important.',

This was the pre-responsive era, where it was still common to see a m.sitename.com in your url, and phones loaded at excruciatingly slow speeds. I remember swearing that I would never learn code. But that all changed when I got my first job. When I had work leave due to an accident, I spent 3 weeks, and taught myself HTML and CSS. I love prototyping and playing with new features.',

Taking an abstract concept an individual or a company and relating that concept to their target market with a literal represenation is one the most rewarding tasks a designer can accomplish.'

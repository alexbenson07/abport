          p.small-10.small-centered.columns.service-copy Design excites me. Seeing something start as just an idea or scribble on a napkin and watching it take shape and grow into a living thing, its the best part of graphic design. Its what makes the hours of research and discovery, failed attempts and crumpled up sketches worth it. Thereâ€™s nothing better than seeing your work have a positive impact for your client and their customers. I strive to make something better everytime. Thats what keeps me motivated.

            p Reworking a project from a layout class, I developed this brand and all of its collateral. We were allowed to choose our own product. Not wanting to use lower quality imagery, I decided to create my own. From that decision, this brand was born.

            p Part of a work project, this will eventually be a boilerplate for YMCAs around the world. Taking current branding standards and updating the look, the main goal is to make an attractive, modern YMCA website.

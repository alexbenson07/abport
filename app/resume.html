          <p class="small-10 small-centered columns">I am a designer and developer in Kansas City, MO. My areas of focus are interaction design, responsive web design, emerging technologies, web based applications, and front end web development. I have worked with, and love, startups and the culture surrounding it. I love the idea of bringing a revolutionary product to market. I enjoy dabbling in all aspects of the web and design, as I find it makes me a more well rounded designer. </p>
          <p class="small-10 small-centered columns">
             
            I graduated from The Art Institutes with a degree in Graphic Design, and I have taught myself front end web development in my spare time. When I'm not doing any of those things, I work on freelance work with developer friends on our side business, <a href="http://midwesternoriginals.com">Midwestern Originals</a>, where we design and develop Squarespace integrated websites.

          <h1 class="title">Education</h1>
          <h4 class="subhead">Not Everything Learned Is In The Classroom</h4>
          <p>I did not take the traditional route for my education. I tell this story to anyone who asks how I got to where I am, because I feel it is what made me the designer/developer I am today. When I started I was, like a lot of kids, aimless. It wasn't until I took a prerequisite for a photography class that I discovered what graphic design really was. I remember walking into the class two weeks later and telling the teacher that I was switching my major to design. I went from there to an art school in my home town, Minneapolis. </p>
          <p>I spent a year there, soaking in everything I could. I placed myself next to the most talented students to learn as much as I could, not just from the teacher, but from them as well. Due to financial difficulties, I had to come home and take some time off from school. But I didn't stop learning. I took a job as a bartender to pay the bills, and during the day I would sit at the bar, practicing my skills. When the opportunity arose to go back to school, I jumped at the chance to finish what I started, sometimes working as many as 3 jobs to support myself. </p>
          <p>From tending bar, to driving trucks for FedEx, to working at startups, I never stopped learning. I fell into a position at a local startup and siezed the opportunity. I have since worked at several companies, all managing their design needs, all while learning front end development on my own. I learned just as much, if not more, on the job at these places than I ever did in a classroom. I don't believe you need a 4 year degree from an Ivy League art school or a prestigious internship at a major design firm to be a great designer. So, while I am proud of the degrees listed below, at the end of the day its your hard work and portfolio that will speak for themselves. </p>
